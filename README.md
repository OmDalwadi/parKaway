# parkAway

parkAway is a parking service where clients can post parking lots for rent, and users/customers can send a request to make a deal/contract. It's a kind of Airbnb for parking lots.

## Key Highlights

parkAway allows users to register an account, view parking lots available for rent, and send rental requests to the owners of the parking lots. Owners can post parking lots for rent, view requests from potential renters, and accept or decline rental requests. Users can view their rental history and owners can view their rental revenue.
